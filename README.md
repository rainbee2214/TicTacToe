# TicTacToe
A simple TicTacToe game made with Unity.  http://rainbee2214.github.io/TicTacToe

I made this game one day because I wanted to just make a game really quickly. It kind of sucks a lot, but the point was to make something :)
In fact, I finished a tic tac toe game in assembly language a few days ago also!
